Using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers to collaborate on a single project because it allows software engineers to work on smaller parts of a project. This could prevent the smaller parts from negatively affecting the entire project. Branches also allow software engineers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.  This could prevent the project from missing its deadline.
